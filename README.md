# TensorFLow training

## Scope

This training aims at teaching people the frameworks of TensorFlow and Keras from a technical standpoint. It is not meant to teach Neural Network or Machine Learning/Deep Learning concepts, instead it assumes some basic theoretical understanding of these.

## Structure

This training is split into two parts

### TF101

The first part mainly aims to introduce Keras, a user-friednly, high-level API to TensorFLow. It consists of 4 parts:

1. Intro to keras: What is TensorFlow? What is Keras and how can it be used to train and define models?
2. Customizing keras models and training: Configuring our models' architecture, training params, callbacks, etc.
3. Debugging model training:
4. 

### TF 102

The second part aims to introduce the lower-level native TensorFlow API and how it functions.

## Prerequisites

This training assumes the participant has:

1. a working knowledge of Python
2. a basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts
3. a basic understanding of Neural Networks

These topics are explored in [another tutorial](https://github.com/djib2011/python_ml_tutorial).

## Requirements

This course was run on Python 3.9.13, but should safely run with any Python version above 3.6. Access to a GPU isn't necessary to run the notebooks.  

The detailed list of requirements can be found in `requirements.txt` and can be installed through a command like `pip install -r requirements.txt` to your system interpreter, virtual environment or wherever you prefer.
